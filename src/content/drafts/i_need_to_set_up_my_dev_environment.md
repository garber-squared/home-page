<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I've been putting this off for a while, but I think I need to set up a proper development environment in Docker or Vagrant. Â I'm running into loads of errors with Heroku and they seem
          to be due to some inconsistency in my development environment, also known as my personal Ubuntu box.<br><br>At any rate, I've been thinking about spending some time on Docker lately, so I'll probably be thankful for these errors when
          my laptop's hard drive conks out at an especially inconvenient moment.</div>
