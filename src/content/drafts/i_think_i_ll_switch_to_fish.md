I watched [this video on Distrotube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux1SP9B5lSQ) and decided to give [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) a whirl.

Two extra things to install that really make fish shine:
- [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish), a grab-bag of themes and customisations.
- [autojump.fish](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wting/autojump/master/bin/autojump.fish), which adds Autojump to fish.  I think you have to install autojump first.

A couple things I like:
- git branch in the prompt
- syntax highlighting
- intelligent tab completion

I'll have to get used to the fish way of shell scripting, e.g. I can't chain commands with `&&`, but it looks pretty cool.
