My first Neovim plugin, inspired by Obsidian Tasks:

[nvim-taskrunner](https://github.com/clockworkpc/nvim-taskscanner)

I've been looking for a simple, non-intrusive way to jot down tasks, and this plugin allows me to write a task in any markdown file. I have some ideas for further features, but this minimal plugin gives me what I need for now.
