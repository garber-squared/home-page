<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">After a lot of fiddling with Docker, I have decided to stick with a simple development environment in a customised Ubuntu box in Vagrant.  I will get back to Docker, but for now I'll
          stick to what I know and get on with the business of learning Rails properly.<br><br>I find sometimes when I'm learning something new and difficult that I have to bash away at it, fail, and then come back a week later.  The
          concepts haven't quite come together in my head and my work blocks get chewed up without my having much to show for it.<br><br>In the meantime, I have a functional Rails development environment with Postgresql running in
          Vagrant/VirtualBox:<br><br>
