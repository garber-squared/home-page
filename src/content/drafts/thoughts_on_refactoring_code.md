I'm working on my CareerCoach job research tool, and I'm finding it very tricky to refactor the code.
There are too many moving parts, too many variables.
I'm trying to convert blocks of code into functions, which means that I have to turn variables into global variables, and that gets confusing.
I think I need to map out in more detail what I'm trying to achieve and then work on each component separately.
For now, it's time for a break.
