What do woodworking and coding have in common?

They are both an attempt to build something from readily available components using common tools.

They both involve solving problems and working within limitations and around imperfections.

Both are absorbing and even addictive to a certain cast of mind.

In both endeavours one starts with a vision of the finished product and works step-by-step towards realizing it. Sometimes the finished product is not what one imagined, and that's OK too.

I like working with hand tools (most of the time) for the same reason that I code in VIM: I like to be physically engaged with my work, be it with a Japanese pullsaw or in a mouse-free-keyboard-shortcut-rich-terminal-based editor. (Say that three times quickly)

Ultimately, both endeavours are useful, can be profitable, and worthwhile for their own sake.
