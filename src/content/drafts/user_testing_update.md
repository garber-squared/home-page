<br><br>I've
        had to hit the books again to improve my understanding of variables, classes, and methods.<br><br>I've been re-writing my text adventure game so that every aspect of it is tested by the Rakefile.  This means that I have had to
        extrapolate the logic of the enter() method in each class, so that a test can be written for it.<br><br>The most interesting parts of the game involve somewhat complex conditionals, written as case conditionals, and for some reason it
        took me a while to understand how to pass on a variable to the method containing a case conditional.  Now that I look at it again, it's very simple, but c'est la vie.<br><br>Anyway, the re-written game is nearing completion and the
        latest code is up on <a href="https://github.com/clockworkpc/tree-house-prince" target="_blank">Github</a>.
