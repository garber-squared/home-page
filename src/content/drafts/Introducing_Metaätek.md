Introducing [ www.metaatek.com ](www.metaatek.com):

A tool for transliterating modern Hebrew characters into paleo Hebrew script. If you've ever wondered what a familiar text, be it Biblical or modern would look like in the original Hebrew script, all you have to do is create a post, type or paste in your Hebrew text, and Metaätek will render it for you.
