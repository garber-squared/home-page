<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
          <div>I wish to thank Gleam.io for the invaluable experience of working as a junior software development intern from August 2017 until January 2018.</div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div>When I started my internship, I had about seven months' self-study of Ruby and Rails, with a smattering of HTML, CSS, Github, etc.  During my time at Gleam.io, I got to learn the ins-and-outs of a large commercial codebase, and
            saw first hand how an excellent product is built, maintained, and supported with intelligence and empathy.</div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div>I navigated the choppy waters of dependencies and got a complex commercial application running on my local Linux machine.  (I also updated the README to make life a lot easier for the next person)</div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div>I got a bunch of pull requests approved.</div>
          <div><br></div>

          <div><br></div>
          <div>I made mistakes, and learned from them, in using Github.</div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div>I kept on using Rubymine until it made sense to me.</div>

          <div><br></div>
          <div>I spent countless hours reading the code, hunting for clues; Google and Stack Overflow were my constant companions.</div>
          <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div>
          <div>I wrote tests that failed, then passed, then failed again, then passed.</div>

          <div>I went mountaineering on a learning curve of Ruby and Rails, especially Rails; now I understand essentially how it fits together and is used to build websites that serve the needs of customers. </div>

          <div>In short, I was given every opportunity to learn from seasoned veterans, the value of which is beyond measure, and was treated with tolerance and respect by everyone on the team.</div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div>Chief amongst the myriad things I am grateful for is the self-confidence I am imbued with.  When I started my journey into software development, self-belief was one part reason, two parts faith.  But now I can say that
            someone saw the potential in me, even though I didn't have the requisite skills and knowledge for the role, and gave me a chance to fail and succeed, fall down and pick myself up.  </div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div>The guys at Gleam.io didn't have to take me on, but they did; they didn't have to invest in me, but they did.  They allowed me to see how I measure up against people who have been working with software for half my lifetime, and
            what I saw (although daunting at times) gives me great hope for my own prospects as developer.</div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div>Now that I have been part of a commercial development environment, I know for a fact that I can become a genuinely good developer with a reasonable amount of study, regular practice, and some guidance.  I will apply for junior
            development positions confident that the requirements of the role are well within my zone of proximal development.</div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div>Every time I turn on my System76 laptop (currently running Ubuntu 16.04.1 with Gnome Shell, but I might switch to Arch), I am reminded of the countless kindnesses shown to me, and take heart that the Next Big Thing in my journey is
            just around the corner.</div>
        </div>
