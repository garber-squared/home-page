```python
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = '8BYkEfBA6O6donzWlSihBXox7C0sKR6b'
Bootstrap5(app)
```

The `SECRET_KEY` is used primarily for generating cryptographic tokens and securing the session data.

1. **Session Security**: Flask uses sessions to store user data across requests. The `SECRET_KEY` is used to sign the session cookie, which ensures that the session data is encrypted and cannot be tampered with by the client. Without a `SECRET_KEY`, Flask's session mechanism would be vulnerable to attacks like session tampering and session fixation.

2. **CSRF Protection**: Flask-WTF, a Flask extension for handling web forms, uses the `SECRET_KEY` to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. It generates a token based on the `SECRET_KEY` and includes it in forms. Upon form submission, the token is validated to ensure that the form submission originates from the correct source.

3. **Secure Cookies**: The `SECRET_KEY` is used to sign cookies set by Flask, ensuring that they cannot be tampered with by the client. This helps prevent cookie-based attacks and ensures the integrity of the data stored in cookies.

4. **Cryptographic Operations**: The `SECRET_KEY` can be used for various cryptographic operations within the application, such as generating secure hashes, encrypting sensitive data, and verifying digital signatures.

In the provided code snippet, setting the `SECRET_KEY` ensures that the Flask application has a secure and unique key for cryptographic operations, session management, and other security-related tasks.
