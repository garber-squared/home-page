<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I have started working through a book called <a href="https://leanpub.com/toyrobot" target="_blank">Toy Robot</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbigg" target="_blank">Ryan Bigg</a>,
          who explains in his introduction:<div>
            <blockquote class="tr_bq">In this book, I’m going to go through how I would implement the Toy Robot exercise myself in Ruby, just for demonstration purposes. I’ll be building it up piece-by-piece with the overall aim to be to
              help anyone reading how to think through and implement this problem.</blockquote>Having just completed "Learn Ruby the Hard Way" I hope to refine my skills by working through Bigg's book.<br><br>All my posts about this book will be
            labeled "toyrobot", so you can <a href="https://missiondevops.blogspot.com.au/search/label/toyrobot" target="_blank">call up all the posts</a> to date at your leisure.<br><br>As per the book, I used the <i>bundler</i> gem to create a
            project tree, which is made available on github: <a href="https://github.com/clockworkpc/toy_robot">https://github.com/clockworkpc/toy_robot</a><br><br>Let's see how it goes!<br><br>
