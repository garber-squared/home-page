  yet.<br /><br />I have working through the Ruby course on Code Academy, but that doesn't make me a Rubyist.<br /><br />I am working through Learn Ruby the Hard Way, but that still doesn't make me a Rubyist.<br /><br />Every day, I get a little
  better and learn a little more, but I'm still not fluent, I still can't attack a problem and begin to break it down into manageable components; I still need to learn the fundamentals of taking input from one source, manipulating it, and
  putting it into another place or displaying it.<br /><br />I know from studying (human) languages, that there isn't a clear milestone after which one says, "I speak this language." &nbsp;Languages, be they human or computer, don't work that
  way.<br /><br />That's part of the reason for this blog: to remind myself of how far I've come at times when the holy grail of programming genius -- not a realistic goal -- seems out of reach.<br /><br />So, one chapter, one task, one problem,
  one exercise at a time. &nbsp;It all adds up, and besides, there's no other way.
