            took me 13 working days to complete my first 100 "work" pomodoros as a Junior Software Tester at Profectus Group.  Much of my time has been spent deep in documentation, trying to learn the key rules that govern Profectus RDM
            software, and I have even knocked off a couple of very simple testing and support cards.  My definition of a "work" pomodoro is time spent either in research or in writing, or put another way, time spent that I have something to
            show for afterwards, be it a completed card, communications with the team, or my own notes.  Breaks, chats, meetings, exercise, and anything that cannot be classified as productive work is not counted as a "work" pomodoro.<br><br>My
            daily average of "work" pomodoros for this cycle was 7.69, or a bit over 4½ hours, which taking into account time spent in meetings, stand-ups, and generally finding my way around the office, it's not too bad.  I predict that over
            the long term my daily average will sit between four and five hours, with the other two hours being taken up mostly in meetings of various kinds.<br><br>Everyone in my team is friendly and helpful, and although there is plenty to
            learn, I haven't been thrown in the deep end, and I am entrusted with the autonomy to chart my own path to proficiency.<br><br>We'll have to wait until August for my second pomodoro cycle, as I will be off from work after this week
            until I get back from my honeymoon.  Life is a lot brighter in light of a job to come back to.<br><br>Looking forward to doing plenty of good work upon my return.</div>
