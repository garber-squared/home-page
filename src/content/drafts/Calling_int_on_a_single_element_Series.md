# Why is calling int() directly on a single element Panda Series deprecated?

## Short Answer

This deprecation encourages casting only a single, known object to an integer rather than running the risk of attempting to cast something unsuitable, e.g. a Panda Series.  By calling `int()` on `series.item()` or `series.iloc[0]`, the code ensures that only a single element is cast to an integer.

To be as unambiguous as possible, it is best to use `int(series.iloc[0])` because that ensures that even if `series` unexpectedly contains more than one element, only the first element will be cast.

## Long Answer

The deprecation of calling `int()` directly on a single element `pandas.Series` object is part of ongoing efforts by the developers of the Pandas library to maintain clear and predictable behavior of the library's API. This change primarily addresses several underlying reasons:

1. **Ambiguity and Clarity**: Using `int()` on a `Series` can be ambiguous, as a `Series` is inherently designed to hold multiple items, even if it currently contains only one. The expected behavior might not be immediately clear, especially to those who are new to Pandas or to programming in general.

2. **Consistency with Data Structures**: A `Series` in Pandas, regardless of the number of elements it contains, is a one-dimensional labeled array. Applying `int()` directly to a `Series` contradicts the typical use-case of this function, which is intended for scalar values. By deprecating this usage, Pandas encourages developers to explicitly handle conversion, making code more readable and reducing the likelihood of subtle bugs.

3. **Explicit is Better Than Implicit**: This principle, one of Python's core design philosophies, is upheld by requiring a more explicit extraction of a scalar value from a `Series` before type conversion. For instance, using `series.iloc[0]` or `series.item()` to extract the value before converting it ensures that the code explicitly states its intention, enhancing both readability and maintainability.

4. **Error Prevention**: Directly converting a `Series` to an integer without explicitly accessing its single element can lead to errors or unexpected behavior, especially if the `Series` were to change and contain more or no elements in the future. Forcing explicit access to the element makes the code more robust to changes in the data structure.

To convert a single element `Series` to an integer in a way that conforms to the current best practices, you should explicitly access the element. Here are two common ways to do this:

- Using `item()` if the `Series` is guaranteed to have exactly one item:
  ```python
  value = series.item()
  int_value = int(value)
  ```

- Using array indexing, such as `iloc[0]`, which accesses the first element:
  ```python
  int_value = int(series.iloc[0])
  ```

Both methods make it clear that you are extracting a scalar value from the series before converting it to an integer, adhering to Pandas' best practices and making your code safer and clearer.
