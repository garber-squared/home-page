<br>I came for Rails, I'm working on DevOps.<br><br>The
          purpose of this post is to give an account of setting up my development environment in order to study Ruby on Rails.<br><br>I am already familiar with Vagrant, and initially thought I would spin an Ubuntu 16.04 box and work in that.
           However, the obvious and numerous disadvantages of working in a virtual machine on a local hard drive demanded that I find something better.<br><br>So I decided to finally invest some time on Docker, and I have to say, once I
          wrapped my head around the concept of containers, getting started seems fairly straightforward.<br><br>
          <h2 style="text-align: left;">Initial Steps:</h2>
          <ol style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Install Vagrant on my host</li>
            <li>Install Docker on my host</li>
            <li>Spin up an Ubuntu box in Vagrant</li>
            <li>Install Docker on my VM</li>
            <li>Create an account on Docker Hub</li>
            <li>Download the Heroku Cedar 16 image</li>
            <li>Create a private docker repository on my host</li>
            <li>Run the Heroku Docker image</li>
            <li>Push a modified Docker image to my own repository</li>
            <li>Pull the modified Docker image to my VM</li>
          </ol>
          <div>And so forth.</div>
<br><br>As I want my development environment to mirror Heroku's settings as closely as possible, I decided to see what the Heroku website itself has to say on the matter.<br><br>My inclination was to keep it
          simple by using Vagrant, but Heroku's Cedar stack is available as a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/cedar/" target="_blank">Docker image</a>, so I will go with Docker instead.  I've been meaning to familiarise myself with
          Docker for a while, so this works for me.<br><br>Official <a href="https://gist.github.com/botchagalupe/53695f50eebbd3eaa9aa" target="_blank">Notes</a> for Docker are available from Gist.<br><br>This videos helps to
          demystify Docker.<br><br>

          <div>I'm now looking into simplifying it further and using a Droplet from Digital Ocean.</div>
