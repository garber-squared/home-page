            </table>It's been about a month-and-a-half since I started my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6300887962762780672/" target="_blank">internship</a> at <a href="http://gleam.io/">Gleam.io</a> and now is
            as good a time as any to reflect on humility and gratitude.<br>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Humility: Knowing Your Place</h2>
            <div>As a junior developer, all my considerations start from recognising the humbling fact that my company does not need me, <i>yet</i>.<br><br><i>So far</i>, time and money spent on me have not profited the company.<br><br><i>As
                things stand</i>, the company would be better off without me.</div>
            <div>
<br><i>If I  do not significantly improve over the coming weeks and months</i>, the case for terminating my position at the company will consolidate; reasons to keep me, evaporate.</div>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Gratitude: Accepting Responsibility</h2>
            <div>In light of these discomfiting understandings, it is clear that a great responsibility is placed on my shoulders.  In spite of my limitations, my boss sees potential in me, and has already gambled a substantial amount of time
              and money on helping me get to my present position.  Even if I can't see how I am to cross over into profitable productivity, he can, and because I trust and respect his judgement, the onus is on me to find a way to come good.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>The way I look at my internship is that the company — without really needing to do so — is giving me a gilt-edged chance to build a compelling business case for hiring me.  I have access to the code base, I can ask for help, I
              have an excellent Linux-based System 76 laptop, and most importantly, I have a generous allotment of goodwill and trust.</div>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Motivation: Hunger and Hope</h2>
            <div>So what does this mean for me in practice? It means staying hungry and hopeful.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>It means getting up every morning with a strong determination to do my best right now, for the next twenty-one minutes, and the next twenty-one minutes, and the next, until the end of the day.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>It means poring over every detail of my assigned task, taking notes, searching for key terms in the code, reading and re-reading the manual.<br><br>It means making sure I've done everything I can and have the best possible
              understanding of the matter before contacting a senior developer, and then asking the most specific, intelligent question I can put together.<br><br>It means overcoming the fear and frustration, the anger and anxiety, of not
              knowing the answer, day in, day out.<br><br>It means being honest with myself and making available a regular feed of how I'm getting along; not a sugar-coated status update, but an unobtrusive stream of reports by means of which
              those above me can realistically appraise my progress.<br><br>It means reminding myself of where I started and where I want to be.<br><br>And finally, it means that as long as I am in the game, I have everything to play for.</div>
          </div>
        </div>
