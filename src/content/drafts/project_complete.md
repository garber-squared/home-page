<br>I have finished re-writing my text adventure game, Tree House Prince, available here: (<a href="https://github.com/clockworkpc/tree-house-prince">https://github.com/clockworkpc/tree-house-prince</a>)<br><br>It
          is a very simple game, but I am proud of all the things I learned to get it into this shape.<br><br>The game demonstrates my grasp of conditionals, classes, inheritance, and automation testing.  Every scene in the game has full
          module testing in Rakefile; the integration testing has to be done manually at this stage.  (I will learn about that soon!)
