        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Week 50 of 2016</h2>
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FZMOWG4qgzQ/WE0t0Xy62BI/AAAAAAAALCw/ZWwWC4yds541vn-GcqcrEraVGke1wF2wwCPcB/s1600/PHOTO_20161211_213807.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FZMOWG4qgzQ/WE0t0Xy62BI/AAAAAAAALCw/ZWwWC4yds541vn-GcqcrEraVGke1wF2wwCPcB/s320/PHOTO_20161211_213807.jpg" width="320"></a></div>

        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Mission DevOps</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Work Completed</h3>
        <div>I started Learn Ruby the Hard Way, got up to Chapter 40, and have been <a href="https://missiondevops.blogspot.com.au/search/label/study" target="_blank">posting about my learning along the way</a>.</div>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Plans for Next Week</h3>
        <div>Focusing on Learn Ruby the Hard Way is proving as beneficial as I had hoped, and I have every reason to complete it by the end of Week 51 of 2016.  Thereafter, my focus will be on <a href="https://missiondevops.blogspot.com.au/2016/12/the-three-ps-passion-presence-projects.html" target="_blank">PROJECTS</a>, i.e. something to show for all my efforts.</div>
        <div>
          <ol style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Transferring my Pastebin to Gist using APIs.</li>
            <li>The Toy Robot Challenge</li>
            <li><a href="http://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank">Advent of Code</a></li>
            <li>Starting my job research web scraper and analysis tool.</li>
          </ol>
          <div>There is every reason for me to get started on substantive projects that I can put on <a href="http://github.com/clockworkpc/" target="_blank">Github</a> and then direct all and sundry to.  Owing to the paucity of code in my
            Github, I have been reticent to contact potential recruiters and apply for jobs, but come the last of December, business shutting down notwithstanding, I should have every reason to send out missives and apply online. </div>
        </div>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Special Project</h2>
        <div>My super-special-but-perhaps-not-so-top-secret project is ticking along on schedule.  I have a few more weeks to go, so that's all I've got to say about it for now.</div>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">The Odessia</h2>
        <div>Not much progress on <a href="http://theodessia.com/" target="_blank">the Odessia</a> this week, but my schedule will permit a lot more creative writing time soon.</div>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Personal Matters</h2>
        <div>Just the usual washing, cleaning, tidying for the most part.  I have been in touch with uncle, who has been unwell, and attended to the usual bits and pieces that crop up.  One day, when I'm very wealthy and successful, I will
          have a secretary to handle these matters.</div>
