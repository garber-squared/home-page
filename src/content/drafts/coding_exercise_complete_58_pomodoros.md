<br><br>I have submitted my solution to the
          coding exercise for Envato, as part of my application for a Junior Developer role there.<br><br>I spent 58 pomodoros on this project:<br><br>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>7 strictly on planning and writing (roughly 3.5 hours)</li>
            <li>3 on studying RSpec (roughly 1.5 hours)</li>
            <li>47 on coding, reviewing, testing, refactoring, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <div>I do not know if my solution is good enough for Envato, but it was the best I could do.</div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div>There are many things that give me encouragement, regardless of the outcome of my job application.</div>
          <h4 style="text-align: left;">I can code.</h4>
          <div>I have a lot to learn, I make many mistakes, my code is probably inefficient and clumsy, but I can take a problem and solve it through the code.  It is a sort of "hello world" moment for me.</div>
          <h4 style="text-align: left;">What I do works.</h4>
          <div>As I have been teaching myself, it is always hard to gauge whether I'm getting things right, or whether I ought to sign up for a course instead.  I am more convinced than ever that I am on the right path, and can take pride in my
            work ethic, time management, knowledge, and skill.</div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div>For example, I got stuck on writing Rspec tests, so I purchased an Rspec manual, studied it for precisely three pomodoros (black cells) and found I could write the tests I need. I have spent so far 3 x 20 minutes on study and 33 x 20
            minutes on planning, writing, and coding for this exercise. The brevity of the study break excites me, because it is tangible, documented evidence that I have the intelligence, self awareness, and discipline to take a break from the main
            project, learn what I need, and then get back to work without wasting time. </div>
          <h4 style="text-align: left;">I will succeed.</h4>
          <div>If I get the job at Envato that would be great, and if I don't I shall certainly be disappointed.  However, I am much closer to being the best pick for a junior spot somewhere out there, and I won't relent until I've achieved
            this goal.</div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div>I am grateful to Envato for granting me an interview and the opportunity to show them what I can do.  Let's see what they make of it.</div>
        </div>
