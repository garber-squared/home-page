The difference between these two code snippets lies in how they handle the SMTP connection object and its lifecycle.

```python
with smtplib.SMTP(self.smtp_server_address) as connection:
```
- This snippet uses a context manager (`with` statement) to create an SMTP connection object (`smtplib.SMTP`) to the specified SMTP server address (`self.smtp_server_address`).
- The `with` statement ensures that the `connection` object is automatically closed and cleaned up after the block of code inside the `with` statement is executed. This means that the SMTP connection is automatically closed at the end of the block, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
- This is the preferred way to handle resources that need to be cleaned up after use, as it ensures proper cleanup and helps prevent resource leaks.

```python
connection = smtplib.SMTP(self.smtp_server_address)
```

- This snippet creates an SMTP connection object (`smtplib.SMTP`) to the specified SMTP server address (`self.smtp_server_address`) and assigns it to the variable `connection`.
- However, there's no guarantee that the `connection` object will be properly closed and cleaned up after it's no longer needed. It's the responsibility of the programmer to manually close the connection when it's finished being used.
- If the connection is not explicitly closed using `connection.quit()` or `connection.close()`, it may lead to resource leaks, especially in long-running programs.
