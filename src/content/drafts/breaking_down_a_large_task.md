I wish to fill a journal with handwritten entries by the 7th of January, 2017.

I have 94 pages left, and at the time of writing, 34 days in which to do so.

I will start by writing four pages per day, Monday to Friday, and two or three per day on weekends; if I stick to this for long enough, the average per day required to accomplish this task will drop to two pages per day, which can be done fairly easily.

If I can coast on two pages, or even one page every other day in the final fortnight, I shall consider this schedule a success.
