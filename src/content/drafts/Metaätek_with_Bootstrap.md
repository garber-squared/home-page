My active learning of Bootstrap is in full swing: define a desired behaviour, RTM, apply, test — wash, rinse, repeat.
The core functionality of www.metaatek.com is close to what I have in mind for it; each day I think of a new tweak or improvement, check out a new git branch, make it happen, `git add . && git commit && git push`, and then assign myself a pull request and review the changes before committing it to master.

I set up an automatic deployment from Github to Heroku so I don't even need to run `git push heroku master`: as soon as the changes are merged into master, a build with the new code is initiated. (Obvious, but bears mentioning)

This is an admittedly niche itch to scratch, but at least it's not Yet Another Something Or Other, which I can do too.
