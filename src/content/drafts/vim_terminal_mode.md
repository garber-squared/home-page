I am writing this post in VIM in a terminal in VIM in a terminal.

1. Open a terminal. (Tilix in my case)
1. Launch neovim with Vim Bootstrap.
1. Open a new tab.
1. `:terminal create_post`, where `create_post` is a symbolic link to a shell script that opens Neovim in a newly created Markdown file.

Thus I am typing this in Vim, in a new terminal instance, in a new window in Vim, in a terminal.  The only way this could be better would be if I go to a naked command line. (CTRL+ALT+F2)
