<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I spent many hours over the years feeding my videos through FFmpeg, with sometimes disappointing results when it came to video compression.<br><br>However, the video I recorded on my
          old Canon Legria FS200 was 20 minutes long and 1.4GB bit.<br><br>A simple command reduced it to 97MB: ffmpeg -i morning_squat.MOD morning_squat.mp4<br><br>I tried specifying a lower bitrate (original about 8548kbps) but that ruined
          the video, so I just left it out.<br><br><br><br><br>
