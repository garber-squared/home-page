<br>Although
          it took me quite a bit longer than I expected, I am very pleased that I have *just about* finished Learn Ruby the Hard Way.  The final couple chapters are on Sinatra, which I don't strictly need, as I will focus on Rails.<br><br>I
          started working through this book in late November, and were it not for my record on this blog of my progress, it would be difficult to convey how much I have learned.  When I look back at the exercises, things that I couldn't
          understand make perfect sense; problems that seemed insurmountable are now approachable.  I thoroughly recommend the book to anyone who wants to learn Ruby and feel free to check out my repositories on Github to see how I went about
