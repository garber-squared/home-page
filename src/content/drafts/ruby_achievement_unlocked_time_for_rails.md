<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Having reviewed my solutions to the first three Days of puzzles of Advent of Code, I am now comfortably proficient in the fundamentals of programming in pure Ruby.<br><br>
          <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zmCIXogJEyg/WBAaugos8-I/AAAAAAAAIUw/Rwu_yuSPVfw8pNdQga46Acifhh_Fu9ShQCPcB/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2016-10-26%2B13-53-52.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zmCIXogJEyg/WBAaugos8-I/AAAAAAAAIUw/Rwu_yuSPVfw8pNdQga46Acifhh_Fu9ShQCPcB/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2016-10-26%2B13-53-52.png" width="264"></a></div>
<br><br>When presented with a problem, I am confident that I can do the following:<br><br>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Define the problem</li>
            <li>Describe the solution broadly in programming terms</li>
            <li>Denote the likely classes and methods to be used therein</li>
          </ul>
<br>Thereafter, I am now confident that, given enough time, I can solve the problem.  There is room for vast improvement, but that will come with time.<br><br>I really enjoy the daily solution of programming puzzles, and
          would love to solve all fifty; however, my duty is to prioritise my studies according to optimal employment criteria, and there aren't a lot of jobs going for junior developers who specialise in solving fun puzzles in pure Ruby.<br><br>Having
          passed this milestone in my learning, I am now ready to hit the books again.  My study plan encompasses the following:<br><br>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Build a website in Ruby on Rails to showcase my Advent of Code puzzle solutions.  This includes the following:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Deep knowledge of Rails</li>
              <li>Proficiency in Javascript</li>
              <li>Proficiency in JQuery</li>
              <li>Proficiency in HTML/CSS</li>
              <li>Proficiency in PostgreSQL and/or mySQL</li>
              <li>Writing automated tests in RSpec (my preference) or Factory Girl</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Host the website on Heroku</li>
            <li>Additionally, I will further my knowledge of the following:</li>
            <li>Coffeescript</li>
            <li>Haml</li>
            <li>Amazon Web Services: it would be good to know which services are of the highest priority, as one could spend a lifetime on there.</li>
          </ul>
<br>To gain experience in upgrading older Rails versions, I could probably clone the source code of an existing Rails to a virtual machine, on which an old version of Rails is installed.  However, this is a lower priority.<br><br>As
          all who know me can attest to, I can learn and work quickly and efficiently, and am adaptable and resilient.  I also take pride in managing expectations between multiple clients and communicating with both clients and colleagues.<br><br>For
          the next couple of weeks I will focus primarily on the Rails framework by working through Ryan Bigg's promisingly large tome: Rails 4 in Action.  In this way I expect to establish a thorough grounding in Rails and also a gain a
          perspective on the changes from Rails 4 to Rails 5, which could come in handy if I ever work on a legacy codebase.
