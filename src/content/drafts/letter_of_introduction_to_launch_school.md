            <div><br></div>
            <div>I was originally put on to Launch School by Jason Ona (<a href="mailto:jason.data@roadbytes.me" style="color: #1155cc;" target="_blank">jason.data@roadbytes.me</a>), a graduate of your programme.  From what I can see, he has
              received an excellent education and is doing well in his new career.</div>
            <div>He gave me this referral link: <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://launchschool.com/join/30a771c4a5&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1499747542827000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFDtaI5Vh6RxPi6xJ_hbH_vOM1bZw" href="https://launchschool.com/join/30a771c4a5" style="color: #1155cc;" target="_blank">https://launchschool.com<wbr></wbr>/join/30a771c4a5 </a>

            <div><span style="font-size: medium;">My impression of the Prep courses</span></div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>The preparatory courses seem very thorough to me, and are entirely appropriate for someone starting his journey into software development.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div><b>Easy parts</b></div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>I having spent the last six months studying Ruby and trying my hand at programming, the lion's share of the introductory material was very easy.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div><b>Difficult parts</b></div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>There were no difficult parts.  The only difficulty was in exercising the discipline to go through the ABCs of code after having done it many times over in other courses.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div><b>What I enjoyed</b></div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>I enjoyed the exercises, where I could put my knowledge to use.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div><b>What I did not like</b></div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>There is nothing that I did not like, per se.  400 hours ago, most of this material would have been new and exciting to me, but at this stage, I have to wade through facile material in order to pick out a nugget here and there
              that fills in a gap for me.  The following photographs illustrate the useful tidbits I have retrieved.</div>
            <div><br></div>

            <div><br></div>
            <div><span style="font-size: medium;">How long it took me to complete the Prep courses</span></div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>These estimates are rough:</div>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>About 25 hours for the back-end course.</li>
                <li>About 25 hours for the front-end course.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div><span style="font-size: medium;">Have I watched the 'Mastery Based Learning' webinar?</span></div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>Yes, I watched it.  Almost everything that was said I have come to independently, and I have lived for the last 15 years in accordance with those the principles.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div><span style="font-size: medium;">Have I read the book 'Mastery', by George Leonard?</span></div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>Yes, I have read it.  Here are my thoughts on the key points.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;"><i>The most successful path to mastering anything is to practice for the sake of the practice itself, not
                for the result. </i></blockquote>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>I espouse practice with purpose: neither practice merely for its own sake nor investing one's self in a specific outcome, but rather reaching for an ideal in every iteration.  I do agree that there is value in doing something
              over by a large arbitrary number, e.g. 300 times, for in the process one will run the gamut of ups, downs, and plateaus.  In practice, I agree with the prescription, but I disagree with the formulation of the principle.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;"><i>All significant learning is composed of brief spurts of progress followed by long periods of work where
                if feels as if you are stuck on a plateau. </i></blockquote>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>Agreed.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;"><i>There are no experts–only learners.</i></blockquote>
            <div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>This is a good rhetorical antidote for modern Western culture's infatuation with credentialed "experts", but such a declaration is dogmatic.  It is true that no-one can achieve total mastery (i.e. omniscience and omnipotence
                within a realm), but it would be foolish to mistake Jigoro Kano's humility at the end of his life for lack of expertise.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;"><i>Definition of mastery: the mysterious process during which what is at first difficult becomes
                  progressively easier and more pleasurable through practice.</i></blockquote>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Agreed.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;"><i>If there is any sure route to success and fulfillment in life, it is to be found in the long-term,
                  essentially goalless process of mastery.</i></blockquote>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>This is how I live my life.</div>

              <div><br></div>

                  you have to practice diligently, striving to hone your skills, to attain new levels of competence. But while doing so, you also have to be willing to spend most of your time on a plateau, to keep practising even when you seem to be
                  getting nowhere.</i></blockquote>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Agreed.</div>

                  behaviours into habits. Learning is happening all along.</i></blockquote>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Agreed insofar as the practice is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><b>mindful</b>.</div>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>In other words, if you aren't going forwards, you're going backwards.  I expect to make some progress, and hope for improvement, every single day; my kith and kin have long since learned that I expect the same of them.</div>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>That is why my default position is not to spend money: there has to be a reason to spend it, and that reason has to be compelling.</div>
              <div><br></div>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>I call this a recipe for poverty and failure, or perhaps to paraphrase Nietzsche: a slave mentality.</div>

              <div>And by contrast, there's nothing more deleterious to learning than incompetent instruction.</div>
