  start as a junior developer &nbsp;before Christmas, nor can I expect to be hired before the end of January. &nbsp;Back in September, I had hoped to get a start in late November, maybe get something lined up in December, but that did not come
  to pass.<br /><br />Would I prefer to get a start straight away? &nbsp;Of course I do.<br />Can I change prospective employers' hiring practices? &nbsp;No.<br /><br />I could bemoan the effect of two months of unemployment on my savings, but
  that won't get me anywhere.<br /><br />Instead, let's look at this as an opportunity: I have two whole months in which to learn as much as possible about programming in Ruby, and build up a portfolio of code in Github. &nbsp;I can't batter
  down doors that are closed for Christmas and New Year's, but I can put myself in the best position for when they re-open.<br /><br />So what's the plan?<br /><br />
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>Complete <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/" target="_blank">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a></li>
    <li>Blog about what I learn</li>
    <li>Learn about test-driven development (TDD)</li>
    <li>Transfer the contents of my Pastebin to Gist in an intelligent way</li>
    <li>Build the web scraper for my research tool and get it up on Github</li>
    <li>Build the analysis component of my research tool and get it up on Github</li>
    <li>Go to meet-ups</li>
    <li>Participate in Slack</li>
    <li>Find a mentor to review my code</li>
    <li>Write an end-of-month summary for all the Leads and Contacts in my CRM</li>
  </ul><br /><br />In addition to all that, work on the Odessia, keep a clean home, cook, exercise, early to bed and early to rise, and enjoy every weekend with my beloved, friends, and family.<br /><br />So this year, Christmas 2016, there
  will be no reason for me to slow down, and every reason to push harder into 2017.<br />
