<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
          <div>Going in for surgery today.</div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/1._Dental_surgery.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/1._Dental_surgery.jpg" width="320"></a></div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div><br></div>I will shortly go to an endodontic clinic (specialist dentist -- I learned about it only recently) for an operation under local anaesthetic.  The 'root' cause of my problem is a traffic accident I suffered as a
          teenager.  Seventeen years on, in spite of excellent dental care and oral hygiene, I need surgery to eradicate the problem.<div><br></div>
          <div>I hope to return to my coding work later today, but I suspect I'll have to take it easy for the rest of today, much though I'd like to keep on working hard.</div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div>Wish me luck.</div>
        </div>
