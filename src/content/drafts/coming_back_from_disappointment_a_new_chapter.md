          <h2 style="text-align: left;">Review: Putting it all in context</h2>After 700 pomodoros of studying, coding, blogging, and job-seeking spanning five months, I am still without my first job as a junior developer.  The hardest part of
          it all is maintaining an optimistic outlook after repeatedly being turned down, especially after the excitement of performing so well in numerous interviews.<br><br>But that won't stop me.  There are identifiable reasons for my
          failure, and the good news is that all the things cited are eminently improvable and correctable:<br><br>
          <ol style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Quite simply, the quality of my code, into which I have poured so much effort, is still not good enough in the estimation of the interviewers.  This is good news, for I can learn from their feedback and code to a higher
              standard.</li>
            <li>After one poor performance in a pair programming interview, I handled myself well in very similar conditions three days later.  I know where I went wrong in the first one; I know what I did right in the second.  I can build
              on this.</li>
            <li>I need to familiarise myself with the core competencies, frameworks, and tools of front-end development.  My plan was always to give myself a solid foundation of programming in Ruby and a basic sense of DevOps with Vagrant and
              Docker, and although there is room for improvement in that regard, the task of getting really good at HTML, CSS, Rails, Heroku, etc is now a lot easier.</li>
          </ol>
          <div>Add to that, I have gained a lot of contacts, spent plenty of time at meetups, made good impressions on many people, and have a highly sophisticated approach to learning and time-management.</div>
          <div><br></div>
          <div>So all things considered, I am many miles further down the road than when I set out on this journey at the beginning of the year.</div>
          <h2 style="text-align: left;">Where to from here?</h2>
          <h3 style="text-align: left;">Rails</h3>
          <div>I think I'll muscle through <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">Michael Hartl's Rails tutorials</a>.  Although there are many good ones, this one is updated to Rails 5 and seems to do a fair job of sticking
            to the core knowledge.  The Odin Project looks good as well, but there's no point in jumping around from course to course.</div>
          <h3 style="text-align: left;">HTML/CSS</h3>
          <div>Many experienced developers tell me that most juniors today are pretty weak on HTML and CSS, having jumped straight to boilerplates, JavaScript, and plugins.</div>
          <div>As with <a href="https://aleksandraskeliauninkas.blogspot.com/2017/05/how-i-am-studying-lithuanian.html" target="_blank">other endeavours</a>, I believe wholeheartedly in mastering the fundamentals.  It is hard to make such a
            commitment to something seemingly outdated, but I believe it will benefit me greatly in the long run.</div>
          <h3 style="text-align: left;">JavaScript</h3>
          <div>The debate between Ruby and JavaScript rages on, and I have heard it said from those in the front-end world that the only language you really need is JavaScript these days.  I am glad I chose to learn through Ruby, and having
            gained a grasp of the fundamentals, learning JavaScript will be less daunting from here on out.</div>
          <h2 style="text-align: left;">Summary</h2>
          <div>As much as I'd love to have been picked up by a company already, I am not really behind schedule at all, all things considered, and having taken some time to relax, recharge, and review, I am now keenly looking forward to the next
            couple of months.</div>
        </div>
