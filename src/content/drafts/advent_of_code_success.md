<br>To a seasoned programmer, it's a simple puzzle, and my solution is more elaborate than strictly necessary, but I set myself a goal and I achieved it!<br><br><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qPYwozVNhz8/WL5CP1j-A_I/AAAAAAAAPYI/WjlW6iP7EBoD39_1YGigfIx35AheUBmigCPcB/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2017-03-07%2B16-16-15.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="96" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qPYwozVNhz8/WL5CP1j-A_I/AAAAAAAAPYI/WjlW6iP7EBoD39_1YGigfIx35AheUBmigCPcB/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2017-03-07%2B16-16-15.png" width="320"></a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Source code for my solution is here: <a href="https://github.com/clockworkpc/advent-of-code">https://github.com/clockworkpc/advent-of-code</a><br><br>It draws heavily
          on the work of Ryan Bigg in the Toy Robot, mentioned before on this blog, but is considerably modified in order to give a full answer to the puzzle.<br><br>Today's success coincides with the completion of another progress chart:<br><br>

<br>Working in pomodoros is hard to sustain
          all through the day, especially when a tricky problem crops up -- then it's tempting to stay in my seat and stare at the screen while I turn the problem over in my mind.  When I get up, I feel as if I'm wasting time, but that is a
          misperception.  My records show that I spend very little time between work blocks when I'm working my way through a tricky problem, and exercising the discipline to move away from my desk and scribble on the whiteboard always pays
          off.
