Neovim with NVChad in TMUX: the stuff that dreams are made of.

I started using NVChad a few months ago but I hadn't really made the transition from vim-plug to lazy.nvim and I had never given TMUX the time of day either.

I had to fiddle about with my LSP configuration for Python and eventually went back to ALE for Rubocop, but otherwise my configuration is very trim and takes advantage of the wealth of functions available in NVChad out of the box.
