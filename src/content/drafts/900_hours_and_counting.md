            myself some time to review the experience and work out the next steps.<br><br>Life got in the way of my studies for a while, but I've been plugging away at various online courses.  One of the best things about my time at Gleam
            is that I have much clearer idea of what I need to focus on in order to improve most rapidly.<br><br>For the next while, my focus will be on front-end-related skills, especially HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  I'd like to get good at
            using Vue.js, which I know is a little niche at the moment, but I think it's the way to go for the next few years.  EDIT: In light of some advice from senior devs, I might focus on React.js instead for a while.<br><br>At the
            beginning of this journey, I joked that I'd have complete 2,000 pomodoros (1,000 hours) before I'd be a strong enough candidate to land a permanent junior role.  I'm now at 1,800 pomodoros (900 hours) and my joke may turn out more
            prophetic than I intended it to be.</div>
