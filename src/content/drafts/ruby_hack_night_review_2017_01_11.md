        </table>It was my first proper hacking event since my Linux Victoria days, and it was exciting to sit in a room full of people who really enjoy their code.  The atmosphere at the event was the right mix of serious keyboard tapping and
        light-hearted conversation, and the venue is really quite comfortable.<br><br>We started at 18:00 and worked each of us fairly quietly for about an hour, until the pizzas were delivered.  We downed tools and enjoyed some good food
        and friendly conversation.  After doing the schmoozing rounds, we drifted back to our computers, and the evening passed by pleasurably and productively until the end of the evening at 21:00.<br><br>I was especially pleased to get
        some much needed help with my test automation, and my vastly improved code will be ready for a push to Github tomorrow, once I've tidied up some loose ends.<br><br>(Update: The next version of the code I was working is <a href="https://github.com/clockworkpc/tree-house-prince" target="_blank">available</a>)<br><br>Many thanks to the organisers and I'm looking forward to the next Melbourne Ruby Hack Night.<br><br><br>
