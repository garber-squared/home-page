<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">To be a successful programmer, I have been told, one needs to have the three "Ps": Passion, projects, and presence.<br />
  <h2 style="text-align: left;">Passion or Determination?</h2>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6kqQWXgd4RA/WEob3exjNlI/AAAAAAAAKvU/m8me9rvyScozKJ5K8XQpFTlnwbUhHBvOwCEw/s1600/4585252362_9355efe5c2_b_determination.jpg" imageanchor="1"

  <div><br /></div>
  <div>I know that alliteration makes the set mnemonic, but a better word to my mind is determination. &nbsp;Passion can wane in the face of difficulty, but determination, or resolve, or just plain grit (or <i>vasbyt</i> in Afrikaans) will see
    one through the steepest of climbs. &nbsp;Yes, I am passionate about the things I do, but unless I am determined to see something through, I can't rely on passion alone.</div>
  <h2 style="text-align: left;">Projects: AKA What Do You Have To Show For It?</h2>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LzFhsK7Tq6w/WEob3Y9wOpI/AAAAAAAAKvg/JODhyUewIoUvOvE0R3z8yQgBeB_5xYkbACEw/s1600/maxresdefault_project.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img

  <div><br /></div>
  <div>When I was 16 I decided that I wanted to speak Afrikaans -- a strange goal, admittedly, but bear with me. &nbsp;I had no resources but a novel (Die Koperkan by Mikro) and a school dictionary. &nbsp;Over six months I diligently
    translated entire chapters word for word, until I had built up enough of a vocabulary, and could understand pronunciation, grammar, and syntax to communicate in Afrikaans. &nbsp;</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>I put in six months of solitary study and came out of it with a meaningful grasp of the language: that's what I had to show for my efforts.</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>There are loads of <a href="https://missiondevops.blogspot.com.au/p/learning-resources.html" target="_blank">resources for learning to code out there</a>, but unless I apply my newly acquired knowledge by way of a program that is useful
    at least to me, I can't very well convince someone else to pay me do the same.</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>What attracts me greatly to this line of work is that there is minimal paperwork involved: if you're good enough and are a good fit for the team, you stand a good chance of getting hired. &nbsp;I like that, I respect that, and I want to
    be part of that.</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>In light of that, I treat my <a href="https://github.com/clockworkpc" target="_blank">Github profile</a> and my <a href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank">Gist</a> as my résumé, and invite you to see what I've got so far.
    &nbsp;(At the time of writing, most of what I have to show for my efforts is in Gist, but I hope to change that over December and January)</div>
  <h2 style="text-align: left;">Presence: Networking, Schmoozing, Putting Yourself Out There</h2>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-da_92SrmusQ/WEob36FaakI/AAAAAAAAKvY/e69FKgp_THoI8ie06VPIHmlIDmlnAZloACEw/s1600/406971938_0516649162_b_presence.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img

  <div><br /></div>
  <div>For the most part I enjoy being left alone to my own devices. &nbsp;Fortunately, socialising, especially one-to-one and in small groups is not difficult for me, but heading out to the city for events can be tiring. &nbsp;It is easy to
    assume that programming is solitary in nature, because an outsider sees individuals absorbed in their work, but working in a team and getting on with one's team mates are equally important.</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>Those who know me trust my abilities and my work ethic, but as a new-comer to the profession, especially in my position of looking for my first job (presumably entry-level or junior), I have to distinguish myself from the hordes of
    would-be and aspiring programmers.</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>People in the industry have to know who I am, what I do, how I'm progressing, and they have to see that I mean business.</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>See you at the next meet-up.</div>
</div>
