Some time ago, when I was toying with the idea of `vim` or `emacs`, I read some curious advice from a highly regarded `emacs` page:

Learn VIM.

Why would an emacs aficionada recommend learning vim?  I think the reason is that most people who care about either one of these editors recognises the superiority of VIM's keybindings.  If you want to do all sorts of amazing things in OrgMode or whatever else you might turn your hand to in emacs, then the chains of keybindings make sense; however, when it comes to navigating a text file and staying in the flow, I believe vim comes out on top.

I was reminded of this today as I took my first steps in using Neomutt, thanks to Luke Smith's excellent [Mutt Wizard](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard).

The makers of Neomutt (and presumably Mutt, but I've never used it), have ensured that the standard keybindings make sense to a proficient vim user.  So vim is not only an amazing, extensible text editor, but also gives you access to a whole world of command-line applications.

By the way, all these posts are written in vim, if you were wondering.
