             My learning curve is very steep, for it includes, amongst other things:<br>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
              <li>A new IDE. (Rubymine instead of Atom)</li>
              <li>Tighter security settings around my Github account, which is rather a good thing.</li>
              <li>Getting a large and complicated server with many dependencies running on my machine.</li>
              <li>Getting a new System76 Gazelle Linux box. (Amazing!)</li>
              <li>Writing RSpecs at a level of complexity far above anything I've learned.</li>
              <li>Using Rubocop — really not hard, I actually quite like it.</li>
            </ul>Edging out the excitement of my very own System76 laptop — I've been on cloud nine since Gleam.io generously purchased it for me — is my first successful pull request.<br><br>To a seasoned programmer, it was a small thing, but
            it is a momentous occasion for me.<br><br>And may it be the first of many.
