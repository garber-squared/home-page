When I turned up at the annual Melbourne Code retreat, I was nervous and reticent.

I am not a professional programmer -- yet -- and I had no illusions of keeping pace with people who do this for a living.

Nevertheless, I stuck it out and learned an awful lot. Â The organisers Tomasz and Ilya did a fine job of running the event, and I appreciate their encouragement.

## Conclusions and Ideas:
* Do puzzle programming.
* Make code kata a regular practice.
* Focus on one language, either Python or Ruby and learn programming concepts thoroughly.
* Attend programming meet-ups, preferably for Python or Ruby, and seek out a mentor.
* Attend a DevOps meet-up, at least once.
* Make code dojos and retreats a priority.
* Learn TDD. (Test-driven development)
* Familiarise myself with a testing framework.
* Using a text editor and the terminal is all well and good when starting out, but using a properly kitted out IDE is essential.

I will return to this post and add more.

## UPDATE: 
Some useful comments:
* Pick one IDE and get settled.
* Choose one that supports multiple languages: python, ruby, etc.
* Eventually you'll want to learn emacs or vim, but these can wait.
