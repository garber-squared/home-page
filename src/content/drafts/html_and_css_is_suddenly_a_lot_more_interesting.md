          don't know why, but somewhere into the freeCodeCamp HTML/CSS foundations challenge, I suddenly found myself enjoying it. Â I am, of course, quite familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS, but I had never found it especially compelling;

          while, before moving on to jQuery and JavaScript.
